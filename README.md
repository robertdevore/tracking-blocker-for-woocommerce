# Tracking Blocker for WooCommerceÂ®
Blocks all outbound HTTP requests to `tracking.woocommerce.com/v1/` and logs the original data sent to the endpoint for debugging and analysis.

## Description

Tracking Blocker for WooCommerceÂ® is a lightweight WordPress plugin designed to enhance your site's privacy by preventing WooCommerce from sending data to its tracking endpoint. 

The plugin intercepts outbound HTTP requests to `tracking.woocommerce.com/v1/`, logs the original request details (URL and payload), and blocks the request entirely. This ensures that no sensitive information is sent to WooCommerce's tracking service.
